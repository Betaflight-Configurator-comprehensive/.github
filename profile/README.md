## What is Betaflight Configurator

**Betaflight Configurator** is an end-to-end desktop utility for Betaflight flight controllers. It streamlines USB/UART connection, target selection and flashing, initial calibration, UART/RX configuration (SBUS/CRSF/ELRS), VTX/OSD setup, PID and filter tuning, profile management, backups and Blackbox log workflows. Built for freestyle, racing and long-range builds.

## Key Features

- 🔄 **Firmware**: target/version control, backup/restore, manual or auto flashing.  
- 🧭 **Initial setup**: board alignment, accel, motor direction, failsafe, GPS rescue (when applicable).  
- 🛰 **UART/RX**: SBUS/CRSF/ELRS, telemetry, peripheral sensors.  
- 🎛 **PID/Filters**: sliders, D-min, Feed-Forward, dynamic/notch filters, I-term relax.  
- 🖥 **OSD/VTX**: fonts, layouts, telemetry elements, frequency tables, SmartAudio/MSP-VTX.  
- 🧰 **CLI**: granular control, diff/backup, script-friendly workflows.  
- 📈 **Blackbox**: quick access to logs and annotations for PIDToolBox review.
